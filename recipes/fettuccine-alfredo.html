    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      There are certain recipes that are essential to have in your recipe box and one of them has to
      be a phenomenal Fettuccine alfredo recipe. Years ago, when I was teaching kids' cooking
      classes, this was one of the first things I taught them. Almost every single kid around goes
      crazy for alfredo sauce! It is so easy to make a homemade alfredo sauce that you will never
      buy the jarred variety again!
    </p>
    <p>
      This homemade alfredo sauce is made with simple ingredients -- butter, parmesan cheese,
      garlic, heavy cream, and salt. It's a 5-ingredient alfredo sauce that is beyond easy!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fettuccine pasta</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>Garlic clove</li>
      <li>Heavy cream</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
      <li>Italian parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large pot, heat water over high heat until boiling. Add salt to season the water. Once
        it is boiling, add fettuccine and cook according to package instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet or pan, heat butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 to
        2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let heavy cream reduce and cook for 5 to 8 minutes. Add half of the parmesan cheese to the
        mixture and whisk well until smooth. Keep over heat and whisk well until cheese is melted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Save some pasta water. The pasta water is full of flavor and can be used to thin out the
        sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toss alfredo sauce with fettuccine pasta and add half of the parmesan cheese. Once it is
        tossed, garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese. Add a little pasta water if it needs to
        be thinned out.
      </li>
      <li>Garnish with Italian parsley, if so desired.</li>
    </ol>
