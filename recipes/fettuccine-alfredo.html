  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>There are certain recipes that are essential to have in your recipe box and one of them has to be a phenomenal Fettuccine alfredo recipe.  Years ago, when I was teaching kids' cooking classes, this was one of the first things I taught them. Almost every single kid around goes crazy for alfredo sauce! It is so easy to make a homemade alfredo sauce that you will never buy the jarred variety again!</p>
  <p>This homemade alfredo sauce is made with simple ingredients -- butter, parmesan cheese, garlic, heavy cream, and salt. It's a 5-ingredient alfredo sauce that is beyond easy!</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fettuccine pasta</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Garlic clove</li>
    <li>Heavy cream</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>Pepper</li>
    <li>Italian parsley</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large pot, heat water over high heat until boiling. Add salt to season the water. Once it is boiling, add fettuccine and cook according to package instructions. </li>
    <li>In a large skillet or pan, heat butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream.</li>
    <li>Let heavy cream reduce and cook for 5 to 8 minutes. Add half of the parmesan cheese to the mixture and whisk well until smooth. Keep over heat and whisk well until cheese is melted.</li>
    <li>Save some pasta water. The pasta water is full of flavor and can be used to thin out the sauce.</li>
    <li>Toss alfredo sauce with fettuccine pasta and add half of the parmesan cheese. Once it is tossed, garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese. Add a little pasta water if it needs to be thinned out.</li>
    <li>Garnish with Italian parsley, if so desired.</li>
  </ol>
