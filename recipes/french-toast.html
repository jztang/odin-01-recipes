    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This classic French Toast is a recipe that I absolutely love to make – especially on a lazy
      weekend morning. There’s something special about this rich and delicious French Toast drizzled
      with warm maple syrup! And I’ve been making it for so long that I’ve perfected the steps so
      that it is so easy. Whether I’m making it for a crowd of weekend guests or for just the three
      of us, I can have it on the table in minutes!
    </p>
    <p>
      French toast just has such a way of starting the morning off in the best way. Paired with a
      bowl of fresh berries, a few slices of bacon, and a drizzle of maple syrup, and a dollop of
      whipped cream make this a meal that is always a crowd favorite!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Bread</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Sweetener</li>
      <li>Flavorings</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>Maple syrup</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Whisk.</strong> To save on dishes and cleanup, I whisk together the eggs, milk,
        sweetener, vanilla extract, and ground cinnamon right into a shallow dish I’ll use to dip my
        bread in.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dip.</strong> Once I have whisked the egg mixture together well, I place my bread
        slice in on one side and then quickly flip it over to the other side since some sandwich
        bread will absorb the liquid super quickly. You’ll want to be sure that you are dipping your
        bread and not leaving it for any time to soak so that the bread does not absorb too much
        liquid. Make sure to follow this so your bread does not get too wet. This will prevent your
        French toast from becoming soggy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook.</strong> Once both sides of the bread are coated with the liquid, I place them
        into the skillet with melted butter set over medium heat. They only take a few minutes to
        cook, about 2 to 3 minutes on each side.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve.</strong> Serve immediately with your syrup of choice. I also love to serve
        with fruit like fresh berries (I love blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, and
        raspberries). A dollop of homemade whipped cream is always a good idea!
